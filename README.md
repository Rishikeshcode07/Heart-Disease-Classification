❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🩺

Welcome to this heart disease prediction project! This notebook uses Python's machine learning and data science libraries to build a model that can predict whether a person has heart disease based on their medical data. 🚑

🔍 What is this Project About?

The main goal is simple:
Given various clinical parameters of a patient, can we accurately predict whether they have heart disease? 🤔

📊 Data Description

This project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
You can check it out here: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Also available on Kaggle: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset 🗂️

🧪 How We Plan To Do It
We follow these main steps:

1. Problem Definition: Understanding what we're solving.

2. Data Exploration: Getting to know the dataset and features.

3. Evaluation Metric: Using accuracy to judge model performance.

4. Feature Engineering: Preparing the data for the model.

5. Model Building: Trying out different machine learning algorithms.

6. Experimentation: Testing and tuning to improve results. 🎯

🚀 What’s Inside
